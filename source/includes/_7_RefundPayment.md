## Refund payments

A *sale* is a completed payment.
A *captured payment* is an authorized and captured payment.
You can refund sales and captured payments.

There are two types of refunds you might need to process:

1. **Full refund**
	A full refund returns the total amount of the transaction to the customer â€” it can only be performed once.

2. **Partial refund**
	A partial refund returns a sum less than the captured amount. A payment can be refunded multiple times, but cannot exceed the original payment amount.

<aside class="notice">
Refunds can be made in via the Dashboard or by using this API endpoint . Once processed, it is not possible to cancel a refund.
</aside>

Any refunds for less than the original captured amount will be considered partial refunds.
